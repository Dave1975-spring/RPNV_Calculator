# RPNV

RPNV is an RPN calculator inspired by HP Voyager calculator series.
It has been coded entirely in C in FreeDos, using FED text editor and Open Watcom 1.9 

It has been made for fun, for my personal amusement in making a C code using Conio library for FreeDos. 
There's no intent to make whatever a high quality RPN calculator. So only few basic functions have been implemented, other may be implemented in the future.
There could be some bugs in the code, so it should no be used for any valuable calculation work. Of course it's released without any kind of warranty as stated in the LICENSE.md file

If you have any comment or whatever feel free to send to me a note.
